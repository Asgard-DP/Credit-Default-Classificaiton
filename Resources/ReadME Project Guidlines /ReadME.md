We will be creating a fraud detection model that can accuaratly predict transaction as is druad using ML.

We will be testing our model on unbalanced data to see its efficency and compair the data to 3 other balanced data models. 

After evaulating the preformnce matrix of each model , we will determin the most effevtive model . 

Methods : 

Nural network
Synthetic Clustroids 
Liniear Regression

determine the best model to use on unbalanced data. determine the best model to use on Balanced data.

Test model on Other Fraud Sources data.
